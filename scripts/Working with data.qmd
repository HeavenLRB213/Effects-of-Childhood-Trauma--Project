## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
library(descr)
```

```{r}
library(knitr)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
library(haven)
```

```{r}
file_path <- file.path("..", "data", "36168-0001-Data.sav")
df <- read_sav(file_path)
```

```{r}
library(descr)
```

DATA TABLE

```{r}
head(df)
```

FREQ

```{r}
freq(as.ordered(df$SEX), plot = FALSE)
```

```{r}
