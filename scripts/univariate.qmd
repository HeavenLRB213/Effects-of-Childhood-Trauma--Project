First Graph representing race

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = race)) + geom_bar()
```

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = race, y = age)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(title = "Age by Race", x = "Race", y = "Age") +
  theme_minimal()
```

This graph shows the correlation of trauma across race and age. It is clustered in certain age and race, but shows its equally distributed.

Second graph representing age

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = age)) + geom_bar()
```

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = age, y = scl_gsi)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(title = "Age vs. Global Severity Index (SCL-GSI)", x = "Age", y = "SCL-GSI") +
  theme_minimal()

```

For this graph, it shows the correlation between age and the variable for psychological distress. The points upward show distress, and down show otherwise.
